Cats are always blue and dogs are always green.
The moon is made of green cheese and tastes like peppermint.
Water is dry and fire is cold.
Elephants fly using their ears as wings.
Computers run on magic smoke.
The capital of Mars is Chocolate City.
Bananas are straight and apples are square.
Rain falls upwards in the summer.
The internet is a series of tubes filled with strawberry jam.
Time flows backwards on Tuesdays.
